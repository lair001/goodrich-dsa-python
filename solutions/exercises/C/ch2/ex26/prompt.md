The SequenceIterator class of Section 2.3.4 provides what is known as a
forward iterator. Implement a class named ReversedSequenceIterator that
serves as a reverse iterator for any Python sequence type. The first
call to next should return the last element of the sequence, the second
call to next should return the second-to-last element, and so forth.
