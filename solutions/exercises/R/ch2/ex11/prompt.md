In Section 2.3.3, we note that our Vector class supports a syntax such as
v = u + \[5, 3, 10, −2, 1\], in which the sum of a vector and list returns
a new vector. However, the syntax v = \[5, 3, 10, −2, 1\] + u is illegal.
Explain how the Vector class definition can be revised so that this syntax
generates a new vector.
