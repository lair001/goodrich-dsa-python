In the ***Towers of Hanoi*** puzzle, we are given a platform with three pegs, a,
b, and c, sticking out of it. On peg a is a stack of n disks, each larger than
the next, so that the smallest is on the top and the largest is on the bottom.
The puzzle is to move all the disks from peg a to peg c, moving one disk
at a time, so that we never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.
See Figure 4.15 for an example of the case n = 4. Describe a recursive
algorithm for solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle for arbitrary n. (Hint:
Consider first the subproblem of moving all but the nth disk from peg a to
another peg using the third as “temporary storage.”)
