An evil king has n bottles of wine, and a spy has just poisoned one of
them. Unfortunately, they do not know which one it is. The poison is very
deadly; just one drop diluted even a billion to one will still kill. Even so,
it takes a full month for the poison to take effect. Design a scheme for
determining exactly which one of the wine bottles was poisoned in just
one month’s time while expending $O(\log n)$ taste testers.
