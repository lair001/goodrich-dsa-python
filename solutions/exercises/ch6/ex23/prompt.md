Suppose you have three nonempty stacks $R$, $S$, and $T$. Describe a sequence
of operations that results in $S$ storing all elements originally in $T$ below all
of $S$’s original elements, with both sets of those elements in their original
order. The final configuration for $R$ should be the same as its original
configuration. For example, if $R$ = [1,2,3], $S$ = [4,5], and $T$ = [6,7,8,9],
the final configuration should have $R$ = [1,2,3] and $S$ = [6,7,8,9,4,5].
