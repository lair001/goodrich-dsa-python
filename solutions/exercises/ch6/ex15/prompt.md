Suppose Alice has picked three distinct integers and placed them into a
stack $S$ in random order. Write a short, straight-line piece of pseudo-code
(with no loops or recursion) that uses only one comparison and only one
variable $x$, yet that results in variable $x$ storing the largest of Alice’s three
integers with probability $2/3$. Argue why your method is correct.
