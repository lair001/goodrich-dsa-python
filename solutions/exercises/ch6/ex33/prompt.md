Give an array-based implementation of a double-ended queue supporting
all of the public behaviors shown in Table 6.4 for the collections.deque
class, including use of the maxlen optional parameter. When a length limited deque is full, provide semantics similar
to the collections.deque class, whereby a call to insert an element on one end of a deque causes an
element to be lost from the opposite side.
